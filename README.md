# Sorting-Algorithm-Visualizer
This project is a web-based visualizer for various sorting algorithms, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It aims to provide an interactive way to understand how different sorting algorithms work by visually representing the process of sorting a set of values.


## Features

- **Real-time Visualizations:** Provides visual feedback for sorting algorithms as they sort a data set.
- **Multiple Sorting Algorithms:** Includes popular sorting algorithms:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort
- **Data Customization:** Users can input their own data or use randomly generated values.
- **Control Speed:** Modify the speed of the sorting animations to analyze the process at your own pace.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple and intuitive interface that makes it easy to select and compare different algorithms.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML:** Defines the structure of the webpage.
- **CSS:** Provides styling and animations for the visualizer.
- **JavaScript:** Implements the sorting algorithms and manages interactions.
